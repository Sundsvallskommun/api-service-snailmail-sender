## API Documentation

Access the API documentation via Swagger UI:

- **Swagger UI:** [http://localhost:8080/api-docs](http://localhost:8080/api-docs)

Alternatively, refer to the `openapi.yml` file located in the project's resource directory for the OpenAPI specification.

## Usage

### API Endpoints

Refer to the [API Documentation](#api-documentation) for detailed information on available endpoints.

### Example Request

```bash
curl -X GET http://localhost:8080/api/resource
```

## Configuration

Configuration is crucial for the application to run successfully. Ensure all necessary settings are configured in `application.yml`.

### Key Configuration Parameters

- **Server Port:**

  ```yaml
  server:
    port: 8080
  ```
- **Database Settings:**

  ```yaml
  spring:
    datasource:
      url: jdbc:mariadb://localhost:3306/your_database
      username: your_db_username
      password: your_db_password
  ```

- **Citizen configuration**

  ```yaml
  integration:
    citizen:
      base-url: https://service_url

  security:
    oauth2:
      client:
        provider:
          citizen:
            token-uri: https://token_url

        registration:
          citizen:
            authorization-grant-type: client_credentials
            provider: citizen
            client-id: the-client-id
            client-secret: the-client-secret

  ```
- **SAMBA configuration:**
  ```yaml
  integration:
    samba:
      host: localhost
      port: 445
      domain: WORKGROUP
      username: your_user
      password: your_password
      share: /path/to/your/share/
      connect-timeout: PT5S
      response-timeout: PT10S
  ```

### Database Initialization

The project is set up with [Flyway](https://github.com/flyway/flyway) for database migrations. Flyway is disabled by default so you will have to enable it to automatically populate the database schema upon application startup.

```yaml
spring:
  flyway:
    enabled: true
```

- **No additional setup is required** for database initialization, as long as the database connection settings are correctly configured.
### Additional Notes

- **Application Profiles:**

  Use Spring profiles (`dev`, `prod`, etc.) to manage different configurations for different environments.

- **Logging Configuration:**

  Adjust logging levels if necessary.
